# EC2 Web Server
![EC2 Logo Banner](resources/EC2.jpg)
## Summary
This is my first time using AWS. I've helped out with a website previously, but this is the first time making my own without help. The contents of the web server will improve as I progress in learning Apache, HTML, CSS, and Javascript. The goal is to make a porfolio website with a basic HTML framework then add some CSS and Javascript. I have deployed a t2.micro instance using free tier credits and will be maintaining that as well as this GitHub repository by extension.

## Goal
Obtain an understanding of how to deploy and maintain a web server through an AWS EC2 instance.

## Recommended DNS Services (FREE)
Amazon Route 53 is really easy to connect to an instance. But, the cheapest domain I know of is .click and it's $3 a month.

* [No-IP Dynamic DNS](https://www.noip.com/) - This is the one I'm currently using.
    * **Pros:** Dynamic DNS. Easy to use. From what I know, no need for renewal. FREE.
    * **Cons:** 1 Free DNS Per Account. Domains are: .hopto.org, .zapto.org, .sytes.net, and .ddns.net.

* [Freenom](https://www.freenom.com/)
    * **Pros:** Static DNS. Easy to use, configurable to an extent. FREE.
    * **Cons:** No limit that I'm aware of. Renewal every year. Domains are: .tk, .ml, .ga, .cf, and .gq.
**IMPORTANT NOTE: FreeNom is not accepting new Domains currently. Date of Note: 1/24/2023**
